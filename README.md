#  COVID-19 Data Dashboard: From Comorbidities to Capacity

This project is my attempt to explore how COVID-19 affected the world — not just through numbers, but through patterns, vulnerabilities, and responses that shaped outcomes globally.

##  What I Built

I created this interactive Tableau dashboard to understand and visualize how different factors — like pre-existing health conditions, healthcare capacity, government policies, and vaccination rates — impacted COVID-19 death trends across countries.

##  My Dashboard Tells

###  1. Global COVID-19 Death Trends  
I started by visualizing how new deaths evolved over time. The spikes in the middle months clearly show the intensity of global waves and how differently each continent was impacted.

###  2. Deaths vs. Diabetes Prevalence  
This scatter plot helped me explore a big question: were people with existing conditions more at risk?  
The data suggests that countries with higher diabetes prevalence did see more deaths — confirming how comorbidities matter.

###  3. Government Stringency vs. Deaths  
Here, I looked at how policy restrictions aligned with death trends.  
What I found was fascinating: strict rules didn’t always mean fewer deaths, possibly because of timing, enforcement, or other unseen factors.

###  4. Vaccination Rate vs. Death Rate  
I created a world map to visualize vaccination coverage against death rates.  
There’s a clear pattern — countries with higher vaccination rates typically had fewer deaths. It reinforces how critical vaccination was in saving lives.

###  5. Hospital Infrastructure and Strain  
Finally, I wanted to look at the role of healthcare systems.  
This bubble chart compares hospital beds and ICU usage. It was evident that under-resourced regions faced more strain and worse outcomes.

##  What I Learned

- Health conditions like diabetes made populations more vulnerable  
- Strict policies helped — but timing and context were key  
- Vaccines saved lives, and countries that deployed them early saw better results  
- Healthcare capacity was a make-or-break factor during surges

  - Scatter plot  
  - Dual-axis combo  
  - Filled maps  
  - Packed bubbles

##  Why I Did This

I believe data tells stories — and this project was about learning to ask the right questions, not just analyze numbers.  
Building this dashboard helped me connect technical skills with real-world impact, and I hope it does the same for others who explore it.
