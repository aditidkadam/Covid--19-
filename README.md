#  COVID-19 Data Dashboard: From Comorbidities to Capacity

This dashboard explores how COVID-19 mortality was influenced not just by infection counts, but by deeper health, policy, and infrastructure factors across the globe. Using real-world data and Tableau visualizations, I tried to go beyond the headlines — to understand the patterns behind the pandemic.

##  Data Journey

COVID-19 was not just a virus — it was a stress test for global healthcare systems, policy-making, and social equity. In this project, I asked:  
- Did pre-existing health conditions like diabetes worsen outcomes?
- Were stricter government policies effective in reducing death rates?
- How much did vaccination and hospital readiness matter?

To answer these, I created five key visualizations:

---

###  1. Global COVID-19 Death Trends

> **What I Saw:**  
Spikes in new deaths revealed clear waves of infection, with each continent experiencing peaks at different times.

> **Why It Matters:**  
This helped set the foundation — showing how the pandemic evolved geographically and temporally.

---

###  2. Deaths vs. Diabetes Prevalence

> **What I Saw:**  
Countries with higher diabetes prevalence often had higher death rates per million.

> **Why It Matters:**  
Comorbidities like diabetes made populations more vulnerable — data confirmed what doctors feared.

---

###  3. Government Stringency vs. Deaths

> **What I Saw:**  
Stricter policies didn’t always lead to fewer deaths — timing and consistency varied.

> **Why It Matters:**  
It showed that just enforcing restrictions isn’t enough — public compliance and policy timing are crucial.

---

###  4. Vaccination Rate vs. Death Rate

> **What I Saw:**  
Countries with higher vaccination coverage saw significantly fewer deaths.

> **Why It Matters:**  
Vaccines work — and this map made that visually undeniable.

---

###  5. Hospital Infrastructure and Strain

> **What I Saw:**  
Under-resourced regions with fewer hospital beds and higher ICU strain experienced more deaths.

> **Why It Matters:**  
Preparedness in terms of infrastructure is a life-saving factor in future pandemics.

##  Key Takeaways

- **Diabetes** is a silent killer during pandemics.
- **Strict policies** aren’t always effective unless timely and enforced well.
- **Vaccines** are essential — countries that prioritized them saved lives.
- **Healthcare infrastructure** can either hold the line or collapse under pressure.

##  Why I Built This

I believe good data storytelling is about more than just charts — it’s about curiosity, empathy, and making insight accessible. This dashboard helped me blend technical skills with real-world meaning, and I hope it helps others reflect on what data can really tell us when we listen closely.
